## Our App
<p>Guide your colony to reach the divine heights of globANT conquest! GROW your colony, LIFT food/resources, BITE those who threaten The Queen’s dominance, CLAIM territories, and most of importantly, WORK FOR THE QUEEN! This Pluto’s Playground’s production inspired by the popular Facebook group “A group where we all pretend to be ants in an ant colony” gives her beloved ants the opportunity to manage an ant colony on behalf of The Queen. </p>
